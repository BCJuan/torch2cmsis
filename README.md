# torch2cmsis

Library for converting a neural network developed in Pytorch to CMSIS Legacy API. 

## Development

+ [ ] Layers:
    + [x] Conv2d 
    + [x] Dense
    + [ ] MaxPool2d
    + [ ] AvgPool2d
    + [ ] DepthwiseConv2d
+ [ ] Quantization
    + [x] q7
    + [ ] q15
+ Other matters:
    + [ ] Non square matrices
    + [ ] Concatenation
    + [ ] Element Wise Addition
    + [ ] Element Wise Product
+ Automatic code generation
    + ...
+ Adaptation to s8 scheme
